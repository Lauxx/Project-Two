# Project-Two

This is an app for Missoula community members to connect with each other through hugs! It was conceived after an individual approached her friend, a student at the Montana Code School, and suggested they undertake building this as part of their second round of projects.

Recent evidence seems to suggest that people in our society are uncomfortable with physical intimacy and tend to associate it with sexual intimacy, and that the ability to engage physiaclly with others in a non-sexual manner has many therapeutic benefits. We hope this project will help facilitate healthy connections between friends and even strangers through hugs!
